🌾 AI Smart Farming Assistant (RAG + Crop Advisory System)
📌 Project Title
AI-Powered Smart Farming Assistant using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Vector Database
🧠 Project Idea
This project is an AI-based agriculture assistant that helps farmers and users get instant guidance on crops, soil, fertilizers, pests, and diseases. It uses RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) to retrieve relevant farming knowledge from a dataset and generate accurate answers using an LLM.
🚨 Problem Statement
